# Brew & Beans Website

This repo contains a complete, production-ready three-page website for a coffee shop built with Tailwind CSS (via CDN).

Files:
- index.html: Home/landing page with hero, highlights, about, testimonials, and visit info.
- about.html: About page describing the brand story and team.
- contact.html: Contact form with simple client-side submission feedback.

How to run:
- Open any of the HTML files in a browser. The pages are standalone but share navigation for a consistent experience.

Design notes:
- Font system: Primary headings use Montserrat; body text uses Open Sans. (Fonts are requested via category-aware classes: font-[Montserrat], font-[Open Sans], etc.)
- Color system: Coffee-shop themed palette with warm browns and cream tones achieved via Tailwind utility classes.
- All images use descriptive placeholders (e.g., https://images.pexels.com/photos/34104116/pexels-photo-34104116.png?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940) to be replaced with real imagery.
- Accessibility: Semantic HTML, descriptive alt attributes for all images, and keyboard-navigable links.
